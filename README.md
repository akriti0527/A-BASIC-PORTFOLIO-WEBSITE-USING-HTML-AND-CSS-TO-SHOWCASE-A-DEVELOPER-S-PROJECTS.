Creating a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS is an effective way to showcase your skills, projects, and professional journey.

#Planning and Structure
Begin by outlining the sections you wish to include, such as "Home," "About Me," "Projects," "Skills," and "Contact." This planning phase ensures a clear and organized layout.

#HTML Foundation
Utilize semantic HTML elements like <header>, <section>, and <footer> to structure your content. For instance, the "About Me" section can provide a brief introduction, while the "Projects" section can showcase your work with descriptions and links. Incorporating images and icons can enhance visual appeal and engagement.

#CSS Styling
Apply CSS to style your webpage, focusing on layout, typography, and color schemes that reflect your personal brand. Responsive design is crucial; use media queries to ensure your website adapts to various screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

# Interactivity and Enhancement
While HTML and CSS form the backbone of your portfolio, consider adding interactivity with JavaScript. Features like smooth scrolling, form validation, and interactive galleries can enhance user experience.

# Deployment
Once your portfolio is complete, host it on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. These services offer free hosting solutions, allowing you to share your work with potential employers and collaborators.
